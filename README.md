INTRODUCTION
============

SETUP
=====

Install Impairative with your plugin manager of choice. There is no need to call `require'impairative'.setup`.

CONTROLING OPTIONS
------------------

Impairative can create keymaps for option toggling.

First, create an helper object with the keymap prefixes:

```lua
require'impairative'.toggling {
    enable = '[o',
    disable = ']o',
    toggle = 'yo',
}
```

There are two ways to use Impairative's helper objects:

* Set them to a variable and use that variable:
  ```lua
  local t = require'impairative'.toggling { ... }
  t:option { ... }
  t:option { ... }
  t:option { ... }
  t:option { ... }
  ```
* Fluent API - since each key-setting method returns the helper, these methods can be chained:
  ```lua
  require'impairative'.toggling { ... }
  :option { ... }
  :option { ... }
  :option { ... }
  :option { ... }
  ```

To create keymaps for a Vim option, use the `:option` method. For example:

```lua
require'impairative'.toggling { ... }
:option {
    key = 's',
    option = 'spell',
}
```

Assuming `toggling` was called with `[o`, `]o` and `yo` as above, this will create a `[os` keymap to enable spellcheck, `]os` to disable it, and `yos` to toggle it.

For options with non-boolean values, a `values` parameter can be used to tell Impairative what is considered "on" and what is considered "off". For example:

```lua
require'impairative'.toggling { ... }
:option {
    key = 'v',
    option = 'virtualedit',
    values = { [true] = 'all', [false] = '' }
}
```

If the option is not part of `vim.o`, but still acts as a field in a Lua table, the `:field` method can be used:

```lua
require'impairative'.toggling { ... }
:field {
    key = 's',
    -- Using a regular option for the example because with builtin Vim stuff
    -- they all are regular options:
    table = vim.o,
    field = 'spell',
    name = 'Spell Check', -- for generating the description
}
```

Finally, the `:getter_setter` method can be used for more complex cases, where the option at hand is not a simple field. For example:

```lua
require'impairative'.toggling { ... }
:getter_setter {
    key = 'i',
    name = 'inlay hints',
    get = vim.lsp.inlay_hint.is_enabled,
    set = vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable,
}
```

OPERATION PAIRS
---------------

Impairative can create keymaps that come in pairs - backward and forward. This is useful for pairs of commands that negate each other - like jumping backward/forward or encoding/decoding text.

First, create an helper object with the keymap prefixes:

```lua
require'impairative'.operations {
    backward = '[',
    forward = ']',
}
```

Just like the `toggling` helper, the `operations` helper can either be bound to a variable or used with method chaining.

### GENERAL BACKWARD/FORWARD COMMANDS

The simplest way to use the `operations` helper is the `:command_pair` method, which binds keys for two Vim commands.

```lua
require'impairative'.operations { ... }
:command_pair {
    key = 'a',
    backward = 'previous',
    forward = 'next',
}
-- Note that for the first/last variant we use a second call.
-- Impairative does not know - nor does it care - that they are related.
:command_pair {
    key = 'A',
    backward = 'first',
    forward = 'last',
}
```

For more control, the `:function_pair` method can be used. It calls a Lua function instead of running a command:

```lua
require'impairative'.operations { ... }
:function_pair {
    key = 'a',
    desc = 'jump to the {previous|next} file in the argument list',
    backward = function()
        vim.cmd {
            cmd = 'previous',
            range = {vim.v.count1},
        }
    end,
    forward = function()
        vim.cmd {
            cmd = 'next',
            range = {vim.v.count1},
        }
    end,
}
```

The `desc` parameter is used to generate the description for the keymaps. The `{previous|next}` syntax resolves to `previous` for the `backward` keymap and `next` for the `forward` keymap.

More often than not, it it is more convenient to unify the `backward` and `forward` function into a single function that slightly changes its behavior based on the direction. That can easily be done with the `:unified_function` method.

```lua
require'impairative'.operations { ... }
:unified_function {
    key = 'a',
    fun = function(direction)
        vim.cmd {
            cmd = ({
                backward = 'previous',
                forward = 'next',
            })[direction],
            range = {vim.v.count1},
        }
    end,
}
```

### JUMPING

The `operations` helper can be used to pairs of backward-forward jumping commands.

The `:jump_in_buf` method can be used to jump to a location in the current buffer. It's `fun` argument must return a Vim iterator (see `:help vim.iter`) which yields tables with four integer fields - `start_line`, `start_col`, `end_line` and `end_col` - where lines are 1-based and columns are 0-based.

```lua
require'impairative'.operations { ... }
:jump_in_buf {
    key = 'h',
    desc = 'jump to the {previous|next} markdown hyperlink',
    fun = function()
        -- This is a pattern for markdown hyperlinks:
        local pattern = vim.regex[=[\[.\{-}\](.\{-})]=]
        local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()

        -- Helper function provided by Impairative to create iterators over
        -- ranges of numbers:
        return require'impairative.util'.iter_range(1, vim.fn.line('$'))
        :map(function(line)
            local from, to = pattern:match_line(bufnr, line - 1)
            if from then
                return {
                    start_line = line,
                    start_col = from,
                    end_line = line,
                    end_col = to,
                }
            end
            -- Utilize the fact that Iter:map is actually a filter-map which skips nil results.
        end)
    end,
}
```

`:jump_in_buf` will detect the location of the cursor in the buffer and use that to determine the location to jump to.

Jumping to different files will have to be done manually, using `:command_pair`/`:function_pair`/`:unified_function`.

USAGE AS UNIMPAIRED REPLACEMENT
-------------------------------

To have Impairative register [the same keymaps unimpaired does](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired/blob/v2.1/doc/unimpaired.txt), add this to your `init.lua`:

```lua
require'impairative.replicate-unimpaired'()
```

Users are encouraged though to [copy-paste the file](lua/impairative/replicate-unimpaired.lua) and edit it to their own liking.

Impairative's version of the keymaps has several differences from unimpaired's behavior:

* unimpaired's normal mode version of `[e` and `]e` work on the current line. In Impairative, they are operators.
* unimpaired's URL encoding encode spaces a `%20`. Impairative encodes them as `+`.
* Impairative's C string decoder (`]y` / `]C`) knows how to decode 32bit Unicode codepoints (the ones that start with `\U`)
* Impairative does not implement unimpaired's paste-related keymaps, because in Neovim the `'paste'` option is obsolete.
* unimpaired's `[n` and `]n` work as a text object when used after an operator. Imerative's version of them works as one would expect - regular motions.
